# Deep-learning
We trained our network using the Neural Network Pattern Recognition Toolbox.

In our project, we first created our net_k and net_b networks in program files with kucuk_harfler.m and big_harfler.m extensions, respectively.
We have added the workspace name of the file with the extension kucuk_harfler.m to the project file with the name of the file with the extension kucuk_harfler_workspace.mat and the name of the file with the extension big_harfler.m with the name big_harfler_workspace.mat.
Our gui program that recognizes lowercase letters is named project_gui_kucuk.m.
Our gui program that recognizes capital letters is named project_gui_buyuk.m.
In our project, we have obtained our 2900x100 input matrix and 2900x29 output matrix by reading each letter one by one over the code you explained in the lesson.
Then we trained our network using the Neural Network Pattern Recognition Toolbox.
We used panel, textbox, axes, push button in our gui design. We enabled the user to upload a file with Pushbutton.
After we made our Gui design, we loaded our workspace into the program and guessed the photo uploaded by the user.
